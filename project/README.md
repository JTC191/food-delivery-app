## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 📦 Install Dependencies

#### Windows  
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

#### macOS  
You may need to set compiler flags to locate `mysql.h` before installation. First locate it:  
sudo find /usr -name mysql.h

Then update the `mysqlhome` variable in `mac.sh` if needed. Run:  
chmod +x ./mac.sh && sudo ./mac.sh

## 🗃️ Database Setup

1. Execute the `Assignment2.SQL` script to create and populate the database.  
2. Ensure the following line is updated in your Flask config:  
app.config['MYSQL_PASSWORD'] = 'your_password_here'

> Replace `'your_password_here'` with your actual MySQL root password.

- Restaurant — Stores restaurants  
- RestaurantItem — Many-to-many relationship between food and restaurants  
- User — User login details and roles  
- Admin — Users with admin privileges  
- Basket — One basket per user (auto-generated on sign-up)
